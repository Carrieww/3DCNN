# A Clustered 3DCNN Model for Agricultural Commodity Futures Prices Forecasts
This repository is the code for the paper "Using a novel clustered 3D-CNN model for improving crop future price prediction".
It contains two folders: the data (split and indicated by test and train) and the pretrained 3D-CNN models for crop prediction.
`main.py` is the python file to run pretrained models or train new models with the raw data.
